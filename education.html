      <p class="sub">My academic journey has been guided by a strong commitment to learning and continuous improvement. I began my primary education at Koiayat Academy, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics, discipline, and problem-solving skills. I later attended Moi Tea Girls Secondary School, where my interest in analytical thinking and technology continued to grow, motivating me to pursue a career in the technology field. Currently, I am studying at Kirinyaga University, where I am further strengthening my knowledge in software engineering through coursework, projects, and independent learning. Throughout my academic path, I have worked hard to maintain strong academic performance while developing important skills such as critical thinking, teamwork, and time management, all of which are preparing me to become a professional software engineer capable of solving real-world challenges.</p>

            <div class="muted">One of the key academic projects I completed involved developing a simple website as part of a course assignment. During this project, I designed multiple webpages that presented structured information and included navigation features for easy user interaction. I used tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and style the website while implementing basic interactive features. Through this project, I gained practical skills in web development, problem-solving, debugging, and organizing code effectively, which strengthened my confidence in building technology-based solutions.</div>
